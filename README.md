# Regularization-techniques

Used to reduce model complexity and prevent over-fitting

Lasso performs L1 regularization and adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of magnitude of coefficient 

Ridge performs L2 regularization and adds penalty equivalent to square value of magnitude of coefficient 

ElassticNet is combination on both.

We can also use lassoCV to find variable importance in our model
